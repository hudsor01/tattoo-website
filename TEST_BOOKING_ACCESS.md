# Testing Cal.com Booking Access

## Current Issues
1. Missing Supabase environment variables
2. MUI compatibility issue with Next.js 15

## Temporary Fixes Applied
1. Added Supabase env variables to `.env` (with placeholder values)
2. Created a simplified theme provider without problematic MUI components
3. Added checks to bypass Supabase if not configured

## To Access Booking Page

1. The server should already be running at http://localhost:3000

2. Navigate directly to: http://localhost:3000/booking

3. If you see errors, try these steps:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Restart the dev server
   - Check browser console for errors

## What You Should See
- The Cal.com booking widget embedded in the page
- Styled with the tattoo website's dark theme
- Form fields for tattoo-specific information

## Next Steps
1. Set up actual Supabase credentials
2. Configure Cal.com with your account
3. Test the full booking flow

The Cal.com integration is ready to use once you provide the actual credentials!
