        question: 'What are your working hours?',
        answer:
          'I work by appointment only, which allows me to provide dedicated attention to each client. This flexible scheduling means I can accommodate various time preferences based on availability.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Where are you located?',
        answer:
          "I'm based in the Houston area. The exact location details will be shared with you after your booking is confirmed. I have created a comfortable, private space that feels more like a home than a typical tattoo shop.",
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you do walk-ins?',
        answer:
          "I work exclusively by appointment to ensure I can dedicate proper time and attention to each client's unique piece. This approach allows me to prepare thoroughly for your session and create the best possible experience and result.",
      },
      {
        question: 'How far in advance should I book?',
        answer:
          'I recommend booking at least 2-4 weeks in advance for consultations. For the actual tattoo appointment, the timeline varies based on the complexity of the design and my current schedule. Popular times like evenings and weekends tend to book further in advance.',

    title: 'Consultation & Process',
    icon: 'clipboard',
    items: [
      {
        question: 'What is the consultation process like?',
        answer:
          'My consultation process is designed to be thorough and collaborative. You will meet with me to discuss your tattoo idea, placement, size, and design elements. We will explore reference materials and talk about how to make your tattoo unique. I will provide insights on what works well for your specific idea and may sketch preliminary concepts. This is also the time to address any questions or concerns you might have before scheduling your tattoo session.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How should I prepare for my tattoo appointment?',
        answer:
          'To prepare for your appointment: 1) Stay hydrated and avoid alcohol for 24 hours before. 2) Eat a good meal before arriving. 3) Wear comfortable, appropriate clothing that allows easy access to the tattoo area. 4) Get a good nights sleep. 5) Showering before your appointment is appreciated. 6) Consider any pain management strategies (but avoid blood thinners like aspirin). 7) Bring snacks and entertainment for longer sessions.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I bring a friend to my appointment?',
        answer:
          'Yes, you can bring one support person to your appointment. Having someone with you can be helpful, especially for longer sessions. However, I do ask that your guest be respectful of the space and process.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does a tattoo session typically take?',
        answer:
          'Session length varies greatly depending on the size, complexity, and detail of your tattoo. Small pieces might take 1-2 hours, while larger or more detailed work could require multiple sessions of 3-6 hours each. During your consultation, I will provide an estimate of the time needed for your specific design.',

    icon: 'scroll',
    items: [
      {
        question: 'How does your deposit policy work?',
        answer:
          'I require a non-refundable $50 deposit to secure your tattoo appointment. This deposit is applied toward your final tattoo cost. The deposit ensures commitment to the appointment and compensates for time spent preparing your custom design. Deposits are required before I can confirm and schedule your appointment. If you need to reschedule, please provide at least 48 hours notice, and your deposit will transfer to your new appointment date.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
        answer:
          'I accept deposits through Cash App, Venmo, and PayPal. For final payments on the day of your appointment, I accept cash, credit/debit cards, and the same digital payment platforms used for deposits. I also offer payment plans for larger pieces that require multiple sessions.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Are there any age restrictions?',
        answer:
          "Yes, I strictly adhere to legal age requirements. All clients must be 18 years or older with valid government-issued photo ID. I do not tattoo minors even with parental consent. There is no maximum age limit, but I assess each client's skin condition to ensure it will hold ink properly. Some health conditions may affect eligibility, which I evaluate during consultation.",
      },
      {
        question: 'What is your cancellation policy?',
        answer:
          'If you need to cancel or reschedule, please provide at least 48 hours notice. This allows me time to potentially fill the slot with another client. Cancellations with less than 48 hours notice will result in loss of your deposit. No-shows automatically forfeit their deposit and may be required to pay a larger deposit for future appointments.',

    icon: 'pen-tool',
    items: [
      {
        question: 'How do you approach pricing?',
        answer:
          'My pricing is based on several factors: size, complexity, placement, amount of detail, color vs. black and grey, and estimated time needed. I do not have fixed prices for specific designs because each tattoo is custom-created for you. After your consultation, I can provide a price range, and I will confirm the exact price before beginning work. My minimum charge is $100, and my hourly rate starts at $150, depending on the complexity.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is your aftercare process?',
        answer:
          'After your tattoo is complete, I will clean the area and apply a protective covering. I provide detailed written aftercare instructions, but generally: Keep the bandage on for the recommended time (usually 2-24 hours depending on the type). Wash gently with unscented soap and water. Apply a thin layer of recommended aftercare product. Avoid swimming, direct sunlight, and tight clothing on the area while healing. No picking or scratching the tattoo. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment for any touch-ups if needed after full healing.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you work on cover-ups or reworks of existing tattoos?',
        answer:
          'Yes, I specialize in cover-ups and reworks. Cover-ups transform an existing tattoo into a new design, while reworks enhance or fix issues with existing tattoos. These projects require special expertise, as I work with what is already in your skin. I will evaluate your existing tattoo during consultation to determine the best approach. Cover-up tattoos typically need to be larger and darker than the original tattoo. Please bring clear photos of your existing tattoo to your consultation so I can assess it properly.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How painful is getting a tattoo?',
        answer:
          'Pain levels vary based on the location of the tattoo, your personal pain tolerance, and the style of the tattoo. Areas with thin skin over bone or near nerve endings (like ribs, feet, and inner arms) tend to be more sensitive. I work efficiently and can take breaks as needed to ensure your comfort throughout the process. Many clients describe the sensation as manageable â€“ more discomfort than acute pain.',
