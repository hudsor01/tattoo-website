## Impact

This cleanup should help with:
1. **Build Performance**: Fewer files to process
2. **Bundle Size**: Less code to bundle
3. **Maintainability**: No more duplicate or unused code
4. **Development Experience**: Cleaner codebase to navigate

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run build` to verify everything still builds correctly
2. Run `npm run dev` to test the development server
3. Run tests to ensure nothing critical was removed
4. If any issues arise, check the error messages to identify missing dependencies

The cleanup focused on truly unused files, so your site should render properly now with a cleaner, more efficient codebase.
